# AI Knowledge Compass — Live Presentation Script

**Total Duration:** ~5–7 minutes  
**Audience:** Judges, evaluators, stakeholders

---

## 1. OPENING (30–40 seconds)

*[Start with the problem, then the solution.]*

"In most organizations today, knowledge is scattered. It lives in emails, PDFs, spreadsheets, and chat—across departments and systems. People waste hours searching. Decisions get delayed. And leaders often lack a clear, role-based view of what really matters.

**AI Knowledge Compass** solves this. It centralizes organizational knowledge and delivers the right insights to the right domain at the right time—so everyone sees what they need, when they need it."

---

## 2. LANDING PAGE WALKTHROUGH

*[Show the landing page.]*

"This is our platform. In one sentence: **AI Knowledge Compass** turns scattered organizational data into structured, role-based intelligence.

Notice what we highlight: cross-domain insights, role-based delivery, and real-time alerts. That’s the core value—not search, but intelligent delivery."

---

## 3. ROLE / DOMAIN SELECTION

*[Show the login / role selection screen.]*

"Instead of generic users, we use **domains**—because different parts of the organization care about different things.

We support six domains: **Finance, Operations, HR, Sales, Legal, and IT**. Each one gets a tailored view. And you can switch domains anytime from the header—perfect for demoing different perspectives without logging out."

---

## 4. GLOBAL DASHBOARD (ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW)

*[Navigate to the Organization Overview dashboard.]*

"This is the **Organization Overview**—leadership-level visibility across everything.

You see total documents ingested, total insights generated, and total active alerts. The bar chart shows distribution across all six domains. And the **Daily AI Digest** shows the top critical insights that need attention.

This answers the question: *What’s happening across the organization?*"

---

## 5. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC DASHBOARD

*[Switch to a domain—e.g., Finance—and show its dashboard.]*

"Now we’re in the **Finance dashboard**. This domain sees only what matters to Finance: its documents, its insights, and its alerts. No noise from other domains.

You’ll see domain-specific metrics, action items, and a read-only view of cross-domain dependencies. That helps Finance understand where they connect to Operations, Legal, and others—without being overwhelmed."

---

## 6. INSIGHTS PAGE

*[Open the Insights page.]*

"Insights are how we turn raw data into actionable understanding. Each insight is tagged by **domain**, **priority**—High, Medium, or Low—and **type**, such as Risk, Approval, Update, or Dependency.

They’re written in plain language so anyone can understand them. This page shows only insights relevant to the current domain."

---

## 7. ALERTS PAGE

*[Open the Alerts page.]*

"Alerts are triggered when the system detects something that needs attention—risks, delays, or items waiting for approval. Each alert has a severity and can be **acknowledged** when handled.

This supports proactive decision-making: instead of discovering problems late, you see them early and can act."

---

## 8. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH

*[Open the Knowledge Graph page.]*

"This is the **Knowledge Graph**. At the center is the **Knowledge Core**—our intelligence layer. Around it are the six domains.

Connections represent risk dependencies, approval flows, and cross-domain influence. Click a node to highlight its links. This helps leadership quickly see how one domain affects another and where bottlenecks might appear."

---

## 9. UPLOAD PAGE

*[Open the Upload page.]*

"Upload is how new information enters the system. Any document, email, or spreadsheet can be ingested.

After upload, the content is stored in the knowledge core, insights are generated, and alerts are triggered if certain conditions are met. The preview panel shows a simulated view of what the system would detect—domain and priority—before you hit ingest."

---

## 10. KNOWLEDGE CAMPUS / LEARNING

*[Open the Knowledge Campus / Learning page.]*

"Knowledge Campus supports continuous learning. It provides role-based guidance, best practices, and instructions on how to use insights and alerts.

This helps new hires onboard faster and helps managers and teams understand how to act on what the system surfaces."

---

## 11. CLOSING

*[Return to the dashboard or landing page.]*

"To wrap up, here’s the value in three points:

**First—it saves time.** No more hunting through emails and files for the right information.

**Second—it improves decisions.** Role-based delivery means everyone sees what matters to them, when it matters.

**Third—it creates a single source of truth.** The Knowledge Core becomes the place where organizational knowledge lives and flows.

This prototype shows how AI can act as an organizational compass—not just a search tool, but a way to navigate knowledge intelligently."
